# Conversion from Pycord to Discord.py - Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. Dependencies
- **Changed:** `requirements.txt` now uses `discord.py` instead of `py-cord`
- **Impact:** Updated to use the official Discord API library

### 2. Main Bot File (`main.py`)
- **Changed:** `load_extension()` is now async and must be awaited
- **Changed:** Command syncing now uses `bot.tree.sync()` instead of `bot.sync_commands()`
- **Changed:** Clearing commands uses `bot.tree.clear_commands()` 

### 3. Cogs Architecture
- **Changed:** All cogs now use `app_commands` instead of pycord's slash command decorators
- **Changed:** `@slash_command` → `@app_commands.command`
- **Changed:** `SlashCommandGroup` → Individual commands with descriptive names
- **Changed:** `ApplicationContext` → `discord.Interaction`
- **Changed:** `ctx.respond()` → `interaction.response.send_message()`

### 4. Command Structure Changes
- **Before:** Command groups like `/army create`, `/battle start`
- **After:** Individual commands like `/army_create`, `/battle_start`
- **Reason:** Simplified the command structure for better discord.py compatibility

### 5. Setup Functions
- **Changed:** All cog setup functions are now async: `async def setup(bot)`
- **Changed:** `bot.add_cog()` is now awaited: `await bot.add_cog()`
